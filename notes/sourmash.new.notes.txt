1. the paramater "--threshold-bp" corresponds to "intersect_bp" column in the sourmash output table.
By default, this value is 50k. When you decrease this value, it increases sensitivity and the number of taxa identified also increases.
Meanwhile, memory consumption increases dramatically as well. Not sure if computational times increase as well.

2. columns in the sourmash gather output table

(1) intersect_bp, the coverage of the hit genomes in bp
(2) f_unique_weighted, the column I think matches the microbial abundance the best.
(3) f_match_orig, the coverage of the hit genome in proportion, max will be 1.
(4) n_unique_weighted_found, number of unique kmer matches found
(5) calculate sequencing depth = n_unique_weighted_found*51/intersect_bp, when sequencing depth is high, e.g. > 10, but coverage (f_match_orig) is low, which means the hit is not closely related to the organism.
