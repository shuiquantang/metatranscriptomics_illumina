Strength of Sourmash:
1. fast and accurate
2. it is easy to customize reference database
3. it is light regarding computational resource requirement

Weakness:
1. It sacrifices sensitivity a lot for accuracy. It barely detects microbes in samples that has a large human DNA background. But it is perfect for human fecal samples.


Summary of my experiences of using it.

1. Adapter and quality trimming by Trimmomatic
2. Khmer, trim-low-abund.py
https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer/blob/master/scripts/trim-low-abund.py
trim-low-abund.py -C 3 -Z 18 -V --gzip $output_dir/$i.TM.fastq.gz -o $output_dir/$i.fastq.gz

step 3-5 in parallel based on available cpu cores and memory (24G per sample)
3. sourmash sketch dna -p k=$j,scaled=1000,abund $fastq -o $fastq_sig --name $i 2>> $log
kmersize= 21, 31, 51
Ideally use 51 for best taxonomy resolution with microbial samples that have good reference databases, such as human feces; use 31 and 21 for samples that do not have good reference databases, such as canine fecal sample and soil samples.

4. sourmash gather $fastq_sig $genbank_v $genbank_p $genbank_f $GTDB_all $zymo_genomes $host_genomes --dna --ksize $j --threshold-bp 50000 -o $sketch_output 2>> $log
The value of --threshold-bp is only parameter to my knowledge adjustable. It affects specificity (false positives) and sensitivity (false negatives).

reference databased used are:
    my $genbank_v = "$sourmash_database/genbank-2022.03-viral-k$j.zip";
    my $genbank_p = "$sourmash_database/genbank-2022.03-protozoa-k$j.zip";
    my $genbank_f = "$sourmash_database/genbank-2022.03-fungi-k$j.zip";
    my $GTDB_all = "$sourmash_database/gtdb-rs207.genomic.k$j.zip"; (all genomes rather than just the representative species genomes)
    my $zymo_genomes = "$sourmash_database/zymo_genomes.k$j.zip";
    my $host_genomes = "$sourmash_database/host_genomes.k$j.zip";
This is a choice considering comprehensive coverage, good accuracy for prokaryotes (GTDB) and separately common host genomes (mostly common host or common model organism of mammals), this database is very big.

GTDB databases have reference genomes at different kmer-size and format (i.e. zip, SBT, LCA). I haven't fully tested other formats, i.e. SBT and LCA. 
When I try to convert virus, fungi and protozoa genomes into SBT and LCA, it seems extremely slow. so I give up.
The PacBio assembly pipeline also uses Sourmash and it uses only the zip format of the reference database. This is why I stay with the zip format.


5. sourmash tax annotate -g $sketch_output -t $gb_lineage_v $gb_lineage_p $gb_lineage_f $GTDB_lineage $MAGs_lineage $zymo_genome_tax $host_genome_tax 2>> $log

6. combined the results of all samples together into one abundance table

Remove false positives:

	    my $identity = $info{$i}{'match_containment_ani'};
            my $intersect_bp = $info{$i}{'unique_intersect_bp'};
            if (($identity >= 0.935)||($intersect_bp>1000000)) {
                push(@reliable_strains, $i);
            }

Calculate the abundance based on:

$sum+=$info{$i}{'f_unique_weighted'};
Calculating the abundance this way seems to get the abundance similar to the percentage abundance by DNA abundance of different microbes

7. Convert the relative abundance to a pseduo-read table by multiple the percentage abundance with a integer, e.g. 1,000,000,
then convert the table further into a biom format so that we can use some Qiime functions to generate barplots and run alpha and beta-diversity analyses.
